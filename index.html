        <!--to my dear-->
        <p align="center">
<br/>I love you,
<br/>Not only for what you are,
<br/>But for what I am
<br/>When I am with you.
<br/>
<br/>I love you,
<br/>Not only for what
<br/>You have made of yourself,
<br/>But for what
<br/>You are making of me.
<br/>I love you
<br/>For the part of me
<br/>That you bring out;
<br/>I love you
<br/>For putting your hand
<br/>Into my heaped-up heart
<br/>And passing over
<br/>All the foolish, weak things
<br/>That you can’t help
<br/>Dimly seeing there,
<br/>And for drawing out
<br/>Into the light
<br/>All the beautiful belongings
<br/>That no one else had looked
<br/>Quite far enough to find.
<br/>
<br/>I love you because you
<br/>Are helping me to make
<br/>Of the lumber of my life
<br/>Not a tavern
<br/>But a temple;
<br/>Out of the works
<br/>Of my every day
<br/>Not a reproach
<br/>But a song.
<br/>
<br/>I love you
<br/>Because you have done
<br/>More than any creed
<br/>Could have done
<br/>To make me good
<br/>And more than any fate
<br/>Could have done
<br/>To make me happy.
<br/>You have done it
<br/>Without a touch,
<br/>Without a word,
<br/>Without a sign.
<br/>You have done it
<br/>By being yourself.
<br/>Perhaps that is what
<br/>Being a friend means,
<br/>After all.
<br/>
